# Day 1 Notes

## Something New I Learned:
On Git Bash for Windows, the `start` command will open programs similarly to the `open` command in MacOS or `xdg-open` in Linux.

Good practice for linking relative URLs in GitHub is to start the path name with `./`, such as `./day-1/notes-md`.

## Questions to Answer:
* What methods exist for opening a git project's remote repository in the browser from the command line? 
    * Check [this link](https://gist.github.com/igrigorik/6666860) for potential solutions (*thanks, Gabriel!*)


### Follow-up:

Create a script that updates all software in Git Bash that will be used for Alchemy, including git bash, VS Code, ESLint - *others?*
